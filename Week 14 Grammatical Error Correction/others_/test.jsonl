be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .","56":"If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me

bigger and faster than ancient time .","959":"Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .","960":"However , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .","961":"There are three reason to choose this .","962":"First reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .","963":"It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .","964":"As a result people can save their time .","965":"Second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .","966":"That makes it

travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , couse firstly you;ll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .","985":"but if we are talking abot travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?","986":"i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .","987":"so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our

it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .","2129":"He bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .","2130":"We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .","2131":"In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .","2132":"But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .","2133":"DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH","2134":"Why do you have to exercise ?","2135":"What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?","2136":"Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in the world .","2137":"Doing excercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you excercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .","2138":"There 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take control of you re weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .","2139":"Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .","2140":"Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .","2141":"I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .","2142":"Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .","2143":"Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?","2144":"Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .","2145":"This composition will explain the two different opinions .","2146":"Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .","2147":"Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .","2148":"There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .","2149":"On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication \" Young people and transport \" ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain \u00ab - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...","2150":"There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . \u00bb","2151":"Although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .","2152":"Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . \u00ab - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .","2153":"Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .","2154":"Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .","2155":"\u00bb says a 17 - 22 years old boy .","2156":"Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,","2157":"According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .","2158":"The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .","2159":"It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .","2160":"Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .","2161":"As a result , the economy has been increasing .","2162":"From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .","2163":"Topic :","2164":"Do you agree or disagree \" Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship \" ?","2165":"Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .","2166":"Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .","2167":"Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .","2168":"It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .","2169":"To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .","2170":"For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .","2171":"People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .","2172":"Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .","2173":"In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .","2174":"The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .","2175":"If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .","2176":"If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .","2177":"These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .","2178":"Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .","2179":"When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .","2180":"Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .","2181":"Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .","2182":"I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .","2183":"The door was n't broke into pieces or fell down .","2184":"My curiosity had put me into a big trouble .","2185":"I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .","2186":"However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .","2187":"I ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .","2188":"I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .","2189":"I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .","2190":"We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .","2191":"Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .","2192":"This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .","2193":"Dear USA summer camps ,","2194":"my name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .","2195":"I consider I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English which is very important to communicate .","2196":"Also , I have a good relation with little kids , I use to look after my nieces and nephews over the weekends and they love spending time with me . moreover I am very energetic , always awake and ready to work hard .","2197":"Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .","2198":"I like making puzzles or games which imply running , jumping which are important for the kids development .","2199":"I am not very good t cooking but because I never have time to dedicate time on that .","2200":"I think that if I watch and learn how to do it I would learn very fast and can dominate it .","2201":"That is a good quality of mine , I learn thing very fast and I also can get used to new thing .","2202":"I am very exited about this job and I hope you reply soon .","2203":"Bianca","2204":"Day number 8 .","2205":"We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter \" safe zone \" and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .","2206":"We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .","2207":"I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .","2208":"We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .","2209":"We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .","2210":"We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .","2211":"In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .","2212":"But private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .","2213":"Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .","2214":"When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .","2215":"If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .","2216":"Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .","2217":"At the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .","2218":"There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .","2219":"To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .","2220":"In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .","2221":"As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .","2222":"Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .","2223":"But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .","2224":"This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .","2225":"I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .","2226":"To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts","2227":"So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .","2228":"The Maze Runner","2229":"I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .","2230":"As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .","2231":"The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .","2232":"The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .","2233":"He has no idea how he ended up there .","2234":"However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .","2235":"The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .","2236":"He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .","2237":"Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .","2238":"The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .","2239":"I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .","2240":"I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .","2241":"I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .","2242":"Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .","2243":"I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .","2244":"I live in New Eltham .","2245":"My area is very clean and very green .","2246":"People there are very friendly and helpful .","2247":"It is a good place to live .","2248":"One time per week on Wednesday , robbish are taken .","2249":"Of course garbage is sorted into different bins .","2250":"That is very good idea , because that robbish undergo a recycling .","2251":"All my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .","2252":"Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .","2253":"Especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .","2254":"New Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .","2255":"Green time in my town is really fantastic .","2256":"I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .","2257":"There were two rooms , smoking room or non - smoking room .","2258":"The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .","2259":"As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .","2260":"All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .","2261":"The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .","2262":"But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .","2263":"Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .","2264":"They have been present in our societies since ever .","2265":"Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .","2266":"Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .","2267":"Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .","2268":"Also this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .","2269":"The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .","2270":"I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .","2271":"But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .","2272":"Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .","2273":"Hi Shrooq ,","2274":"That sounds great , I 'm so happy to hear that you are coming to Saudi Arabia , I 'm gon na be able to see you after a long time .","2275":"But unluckily , I 'm having an exam on Thursday so I ca n't meet you but you can take me from the school at 1:30 then we can go to have lunch .","2276":"My school is really easy to find , go straight ahead onto Aljameah street then turn right beside the farce of KAU university , after getting down from the bridge you 'll find the school on your right .","2277":"So excited to see you !","2278":"Bye for now .","2279":"Nouf .","2280":"Dear Les ,","2281":"Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .","2282":"In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .","2283":"If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World .","2284":"In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Reina Sof\u00eda or El Prado .","2285":"On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Do\u00f1ana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .","2286":"If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .","2287":"I recommend you not to take warm clothes .","2288":"I hope you enjoy your summer .","2289":"Adri\u00e1n .","2290":"Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .","2291":"He is the eldest son of the Simpson family .","2292":"Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .","2293":"He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .","2294":"Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .","2295":"The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .","2296":"His parents and the school principal often punish him .","2297":"Bart is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .","2298":"Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .","2299":"In the Simpson family all the characters are very funny .","2300":"A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .","2301":"For me , Bart is funnier than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character","2302":"It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .","2303":"I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .","2304":"Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .","2305":"Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .","2306":"Who on Earth could that be ?","2307":"Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?","2308":"My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : \" I have a letter for Mr. Samson !","2309":"\" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .","2310":"I opened it and quickly scanned the text .","2311":"At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .","2312":"Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .","2313":"Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .","2314":"Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : \" What will I do with this amount of money ? \"","2315":"Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .","2316":"Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .","2317":"I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .","2318":"First of all they are very dirty by nature .","2319":"they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .","2320":"So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .","2321":"All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .","2322":"I see all these during my morning walk .","2323":"what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .","2324":"I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .","2325":"People are now self - centred and very narrow minded .","2326":"Though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still savage .","2327":"Dear Mrs. Ashby ,","2328":"Yesterday I was in Green Pepper Cafe for a meal with colleagues and I have seen the advertisement for a job at weekends in your cafe .","2329":"I am very interested in this work and believe that my employment background is appropriate for it .","2330":"I am a Tourism

Castaneda del Acuna","2343":"Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .","2344":"The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .","2345":"As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .","2346":"The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .","2347":"Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .","2348":"There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .","2349":"There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .","2350":"Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .","2351":"To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .","2352":"There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .","2353":"People need easy , fast and cheap solutions .","2354":"In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .","2355":"It 's just near your house or your office .","2356":"You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .","2357":"But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .","2358":"And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .","2359":"Is the car faster then public transport ?","2360":"It depends .","2361":"The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .","2362":"Sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .","2363":"Speed trains are always faster then cars .","2364":"Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .","2365":"But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .","2366":"In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .","2367":"What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?","2368":"Public transport is absolutely better .","2369":"So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .","2370":"Informal letter for CAE ( PART 1 )","2371":"Dear Jan ,","2372":"Thank you for your letter .","2373":"I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .","2374":"From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .","2375":"I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .","2376":"In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .","2377":"Happily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .","2378":"In my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .","2379":"Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .","2380":"All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .","2381":"All in all , the experience was beneficial .","2382":"I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .","2383":"When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !","2384":"Take care of yourself ,","2385":"Favius","2386":"The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .","2387":"This whole business started to get on his nerves .","2388":"He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .","2389":"For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .","2390":"The one he dates is Angelina , not Malika , that 's the problem .","2391":"He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .","2392":"She 's not bad .","2393":"And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .","2394":"So yes , the decision is made .","2395":"He 'll break up with her .","2396":"Probably , even tomorrow .","2397":"It all started in such an idiotic way .","2398":"The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .","2399":"Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .","2400":"And that definitely was not the right thing to do .","2401":"At the moment he did n't realise that .","2402":"Only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .","2403":"Dear Sir or Madam ,","2404":"I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .","2405":"At the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .","2406":"I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .","2407":"I speak English , German and Polish and as a councelor it is very handy .","2408":"I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .","2409":"Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .","2410":"I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations .

a qualified lifeguard .","2412":"I attach a reference from Tomasz Jaworska , who was my boss at the scout camp .","2413":"I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview .","2414":"I look forward to hearing from you .","2415":"Yours faithfully ,","2416":"XYZ","2417":"Well , I would like to talk about my school life .","2418":"I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .","2419":"I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .","2420":"I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .","2421":"These days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .","2422":"School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .","2423":"My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .","2424":"The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .","2425":"The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .","2426":"However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .","2427":"Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .","2428":"I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .","2429":"Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth .","2430":"Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .","2431":"I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .","2432":"We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .","2433":"Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .","2434":"The first day started in an important date \u2026 Taco Day !","2435":"Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .","2436":"Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .","2437":"Again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .","2438":"The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .","2439":"It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .","2440":"That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .","2441":"Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .","2442":"La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks .","2443":"Totally recommended !","2444":"Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .","2445":"Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .","2446":"Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? \u2026 El asadero Hidalguense .","2447":"You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .","2448":"Do n't forget to ask for a litter of beer .","2449":"Almost a week in the Puerquitour .","2450":"The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .","2451":"Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .","2452":"You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious .","2453":"The dessert ?","2454":"Ice cream in Tepoznieves .","2455":"Because Vic was almost with a foot in the USA , we spent all day together .","2456":"Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .","2457":"Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .","2458":"The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .","2459":"The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .","2460":"I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .","2461":"Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !","2462":"These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .","2463":"This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband .","2464":"Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .","2465":"Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .","2466":"Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .","2467":"He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .","2468":"Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .","2469":"Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .","2470":"At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .","2471":"He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .","2472":"Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .","2473":"Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .","2474":"And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .","2475":"The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .","2476":"Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .","2477":"This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .","2478":"Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .","2479":"The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .","2480":"He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .","2481":"However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .","2482":"Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .","2483":"These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .","2484":"Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .","2485":"The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .","2486":"Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .","2487":"The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .","2488":"And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .","2489":"Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .","2490":"In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .","2491":"This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .","2492":"For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :","2493":"\" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up \" by hand . \"","2494":"Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . \"","2495":"On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :","2496":"\" Now lookee here , \" he said , \" the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know","2497":"what a file is ? \"","2498":"\" Yes , sir . \"","2499":"\" And you know what wittles is ? \"","2500":"\" Yes , sir . \"","2501":"Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .","2502":"Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .","2503":"The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .","2504":"Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .","2505":"The thief said \" Who d'ye with ? \"","2506":"This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .","2507":"Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .","2508":"The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .","2509":"The story is narrated as it happens .","2510":"The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .","2511":"Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .","2512":"The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .","2513":"The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .","2514":"Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .","2515":"Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .","2516":"All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .","2517":"Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .","2518":"I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .","2519":"Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .","2520":"I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .","2521":"Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .","2522":"This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .","2523":"Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .","2524":"If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .","2525":"Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .","2526":"She has been waiting so long for this day to come .","2527":"It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .","2528":"She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .","2529":"She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .","2530":"After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away .","2531":"After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency .","2532":"She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of \" her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant \" .","2533":"Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .","2534":"A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .","2535":"She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .","2536":"After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .","2537":"At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any sound .","2538":"But then she said \" hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother \" .","2539":"After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .","2540":"They agreed to meet the next day in the park .","2541":"She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .","2542":"Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .","2543":"The most exciting day of my life .","2544":"Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .","2545":"On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .","2546":"But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !","2547":"I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .","2548":"Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .","2549":"Then , I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy , He was Felix !","2550":"So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .","2551":"I was really exciting !","2552":"Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .","2553":"He stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .","2554":"When he left I was sad but also really happy .","2555":"This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .","2556":"L'Albero , the Best Pizza West of Italy","2557":"One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .","2558":"As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .","2559":"The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .","2560":"The space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .","2561":"My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .","2562":"So far I have never been disappointed .","2563":"To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .","2564":"As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .","2565":"Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .","2566":"The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .","2567":"Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .","2568":"I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .","2569":"I promise you wo n't be disappointed .","2570":"The best places for young people in Dublin","2571":"This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .","2572":"It is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .","2573":"It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .","2574":"It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .","2575":"The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .","2576":"The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .","2577":"The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .","2578":"Several people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .","2579":"On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .","2580":"It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .","2581":"Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .","2582":"In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .","2583":"From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .","2584":"Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .","2585":"This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .","2586":"Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .","2587":"The importance of working hard to achieve goal\u044b and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .","2588":"This is a good example for youngsters to follow .","2589":"From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .","2590":"Firstly , sport has become business .","2591":"Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .","2592":"This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .","2593":"Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .","2594":"For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .","2595":"It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .","2596":"In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .","2597":"On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .","2598":"Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .","2599":"They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .","2600":"Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .","2601":"Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .","2602":"The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .","2603":"Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .","2604":"From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .","2605":"Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .","2606":"Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .","2607":"Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .","2608":"Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .","2609":"Dear Mr. Merrifield :","2610":"My name is Dmitry Lavrov .","2611":"I 'm a postdoc in Russian Cancer Research Center .","2612":"Our lab works along with

friendly proposals .","2651":"In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .","2652":"This is due to the low effect of the \" Recycling Worms \" program over the disposal problem . \"","2653":"City X \" incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .","2654":"The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .","2655":"The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .","2656":"The city has many projects such as the \" Keep it clean , keep it beauty \" , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .","2657":"Another important one is the \" Let 's make it green \" , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .","2658":"A later crucial activity are the \" Green Communities \" , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .","2659":"A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .","2660":"The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .","2661":"The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .","2662":"Most of the \" Recycling Worms \" problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .","2663":"It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .","2664":"For example , you can travel to new places .","2665":"Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .","2666":"Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .","2667":"You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .","2668":"But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .","2669":"You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .","2670":"However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .","2671":"But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .","2672":"We live in a time when everything changes quickly .","2673":"A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .","2674":"We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .","2675":"We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .","2676":"And what about houses ?","2677":"Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?","2678":"Imagining the future , I see everything different .","2679":"The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .","2680":"The houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .","2681":"Some of them might be turned upside down .","2682":"Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .","2683":"And what about interiors ?","2684":"In our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .","2685":"They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .","2686":"In practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .","2687":"Everything will be artificial and uncozy .","2688":"That 's how I see a home of the future .","2689":"Glad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !","2690":"I really hope to work with you someday !","2691":"To make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful advice and information you might want to know .","2692":"At the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .","2693":"First , dressing as properly as possible .","2694":"Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion .","2695":"Suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .","2696":"Second , being punctual .","2697":"Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .","2698":"Third , being prepared .","2699":"As the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .","2700":"You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .","2701":"If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .","2702":"Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .","2703":"He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .","2704":"Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .","2705":"He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .","2706":"In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .","2707":"I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .","2708":"Looking forward to hearing from you soon .","2709":"Lots of Love ,","2710":"Iris","2711":"Dear Sir or Madam","2712":"I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .","2713":"Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .","2714":"Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .","2715":"Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .","2716":"Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .","2717":"Yours faithfully","2718":"I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .","2719":"Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .","2720":"If I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .","2721":"Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .","2722":"By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .","2723":"After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .","2724":"For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .","2725":"Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .","2726":"However , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .","2727":"The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .","2728":"Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .","2729":"And you ?","2730":"Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?","2731":"I challenge you to think about it and try it .","2732":"According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .","2733":"People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .","2734":"Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .","2735":"Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .","2736":"We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .","2737":"Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .","2738":"According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .","2739":"The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas","2740":"Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .","2741":"When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .","2742":"Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .","2743":"There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .","2744":"Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .","2745":"Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !","2746":"Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .","2747":"Believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .","2748":"The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .","2749":"Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .","2750":"Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !","2751":"Summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .","2752":"The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .","2753":"In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .","2754":"It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .","2755":"For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .","2756":"I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .","2757":"The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .","2758":"For the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .","2759":"If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .","2760":"Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .","2761":"It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .","2762":"What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .","2763":"For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .","2764":"Two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .","2765":"I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .","2766":"Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .","2767":"Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .","2768":"If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .","2769":"That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .","2770":"I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .","2771":"In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .","2772":"Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .","2773":"It was just flooding without so much effort .","2774":"So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .","2775":"In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .","2776":"Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?","2777":"In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .","2778":"Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .","2779":"The Carbon dioxide emissions is very small .","2780":"The biggest threat is the explosion .","2781":"However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .","2782":"Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .","2783":"Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .","2784":"Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .","2785":"When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .","2786":"The most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .","2787":"Besides , we need something that can work all the time .","2788":"It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .","2789":"If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .","2790":"Lima is the only South American city which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacific Ocean .","2791":"Lima was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 , as \" Ciudad de los Reyes \" .","2792":"Lima has a multicultural tradition , then in it coincide a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , European Peruvians which are the second largest group and the minority in Lima includes Aymara and Quechua and Afro - Peruvians .","2793":"Lima is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the stay of Pre - Hispanic legacy with architectural monuments , called \" Huacas \" .","2794":"The Historic Centre of Lima was declared World Heritage Site in 1988 .","2795":"It is a city that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbor ; their typical dance called \" La Marinera \" ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesi\u00f3n del Se\u00f1or de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour ( wine ) , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .","2796":"Lima is a beautiful city of contrast , where you can find a diversity of historical , modern and business places .","2797":"Archaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .","2798":"Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend your perfect holidays .","2799":"Hi Jane ,","2800":"Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK .

known fact that people need to have communication with other people .","2861":"However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .","2862":"They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .","2863":"The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .","2864":"Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .","2865":"Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .","2866":"They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .","2867":"It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .","2868":"Dog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .","2869":"And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .","2870":"These hairy four -

and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?","3206":"I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .","3207":"By the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?","3208":"It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .","3209":"I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .","3210":"About two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called \" The fault in our stars \" .","3211":"It 's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .","3212":"This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .","3213":"So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .","3214":"Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this \" more \" .","3215":"Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .","3216":"It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .","3217":"It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .","3218":"Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .","3219":"However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this \" something \" is almost everything .","3220":"Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .","3221":"Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards \" progress \" , whatever that word means .","3222":"It is a ciclical process .","3223":"Rome had its

's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .","3230":"A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .","3231":"But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?","3232":"I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?","3233":"The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .","3234":"One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be

roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .","3236":"But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .","3237":"To : Sam","3238":"From : Simonetta","3239":"Date : 05\/30\/14","3240":"Subject : holidays are coming !","3241":"Hi Sam ,","3242":"It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .","3243":"My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .","3244":"Do you remember it ?","3245":"I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !","3246":"It would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?","3247":"Could you ask your parents ' permission ?","3248":"In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .","3249":"In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in

forward to receiving your answer !","3254":"Best wishes .","3255":"Simonetta","3256":"The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .","3257":"I got up and I made my way to the front door .","3258":"Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .","3259":"I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .","3260":"She came down , but she did not scream .","3261":"Instead she started crying .","3262":"The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...","3263":"I did not know that he was still alive .","3264":"Mother had always told me he had died in the war .","3265":"I think she did this for my own good .","3266":"I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .","3267":"In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .","3268":"It was very odd to see him in my home .","3269":"Now we all live together .","3270":"Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .","3271":"It is great to be a whole family again .","3272":"The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .","3273":"It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .","3274":"These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .","3275":"They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .","3276":"Sometimes , they became very rich .","3277":"Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .","3278":"Their architecture is unique and beautiful .","3279":"Today , most of them are hosting caf\u00e9s , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .","3280":"The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .","3281":"It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .","3282":"Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .","3283":"Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .","3284":"Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .","3285":"The first Castle , called palatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .","3286":"During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .","3287":"During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .","3288":"Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .","3289":"Apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .","3290":"While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .","3291":"I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .","3292":"It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .","3293":"Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .","3294":"I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .","3295":"I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .","3296":"My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .","3297":"Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .","3298":"So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .","3299":"Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .","3300":"One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .","3301":"I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .","3302":"Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .","3303":"And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .","3304":"A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .","3305":"In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .","3306":"Adolescence .","3307":"Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it could be also the worst .","3308":"Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .","3309":"This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .","3310":"Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .","3311":"This could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .","3312":"Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .","3313":"As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .","3314":"The worst part is that they get angry with us !","3315":"We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !","3316":"It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .","3317":"I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .","3318":"Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .","3319":"It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .","3320":"It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .","3321":"That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .","3322":"It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .","3323":"Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .","3324":"Dear group leader ,","3325":"First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .","3326":"I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .","3327":"Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .","3328":"On the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Art\u00e0 .","3329":"In the municipality of Art\u00e0 you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .","3330":"Sa Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .","3331":"Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .","3332":"Here your adventure starts .","3333":"In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .","3334":"You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .","3335":"This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .","3336":"For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .","3337":"As Machado said \" se hace camino al andar \" .","3338":"It means that the most important is the way , the journey .","3339":"Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .","3340":"On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .","3341":"There are a lot of trees called \" tamarells \" , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .","3342":"Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .","3343":"Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .","3344":"It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .","3345":"There you can practise different sports .","3346":"It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .","3347":"There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea .","3348":"A part from sports , you should note two different culture points .","3349":"On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .","3350":"On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called \" Talaiot \" .","3351":"The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .","3352":"Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .","3353":"It is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .","3354":"The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .","3355":"From that seashore you can see all the Alc\u00fadia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .","3356":"Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .","3357":"I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .","3358":"Regards ,","3359":"Paula .","3360":"Introduction .","3361":"The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .","3362":"This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .","3363":"The gym .","3364":"The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .","3365":"On the other hand , the gym is too small .","3366":"Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .","3367":"The swimming pool .","3368":"It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .","3369":"Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .","3370":"On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .","3371":"Conclusions .","3372":"The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .","3373":"Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .","3374":"The Future of Public Transport","3375":"When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .","3376":"As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .","3377":"A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .","3378":"Travalling by car is also much more convenient .","3379":"Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?","3380":"In my opinion , it is not true .","3381":"Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .","3382":"Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .","3383":"Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .","3384":"Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .","3385":"Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .","3386":"Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .","3387":"This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .","3388":"In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .","3389":"The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .","3390":"According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.","3391":"These ones are called \" source countries \" , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .","3392":"Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called \" destination countries \" because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .","3393":"Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .","3394":"In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .","3395":"In conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .","3396":"Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .","3397":"Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .","3398":"All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .","3399":"If not killed then more likely paralysed .","3400":"There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .","3401":"This is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .","3402":"More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .","3403":"The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .","3404":"With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .","3405":"Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .","3406":"Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .","3407":"change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment .","3408":"There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .","3409":"Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .","3410":"Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .","3411":"Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .","3412":"In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .","3413":"Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .","3414":"However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .","3415":"Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .","3416":"In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .","3417":"Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .","3418":"Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .","3419":"Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .","3420":"This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .","3421":"How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?","3422":"Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .","3423":"Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .","3424":"In Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .","3425":"The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .","3426":"For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .","3427":"Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .","3428":"Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .","3429":"The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .","3430":"On arrival they see starvation and death .","3431":"Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .","3432":"Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .","3433":"Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .","3434":"This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province .","3435":"Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde 's lovers .","3436":"Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .","3437":"The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .","3438":"Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .","3439":"He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cun\u00e9gonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - f\u00e9 , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .","3440":"Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .","3441":"Eventually , of course , he does marry Cun\u00e9gonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .","3442":"She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .","3443":"This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .","3444":"Candide has travelled the world in search of Cun\u00e9gonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cun\u00e9gonde but at the price of her looks and personality .","3445":"Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .","3446":"It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .","3447":"However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .","3448":"When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .","3449":"They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .","3450":"A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .","3451":"It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .","3452":"In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .","3453":"However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .","3454":"Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .","3455":"We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .","3456":"The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .","3457":"Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .","3458":"Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .","3459":"The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .","3460":"But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .","3461":"Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .","3462":"Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .","3463":"It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .","3464":"Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .","3465":"Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .","3466":"In the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .","3467":"Because of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .","3468":"For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .","3469":"We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .","3470":"There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .","3471":"With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .","3472":"The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .","3473":"Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .","3474":"Will there just be one system ?","3475":"The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .","3476":"Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .","3477":"It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .","3478":"Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .","3479":"It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .","3480":"To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .","3481":"The fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .","3482":"There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .","3483":"Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .","3484":"If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .","3485":"The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .","3486":"The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .","3487":"Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .","3488":"With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .","3489":"I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .","3490":"This loss need not however be negative .","3491":"In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .","3492":"Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .","3493":"Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .","3494":"This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .","3495":"It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .","3496":"However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .","3497":"Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .","3498":"In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .","3499":"As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .","3500":"I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .","3501":"Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .","3502":"In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .","3503":"The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .","3504":"I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .","3505":"Politically we are moving closer together .","3506":"Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .","3507":"E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .","3508":"Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .","3509":"In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .","3510":"What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system .","3511":"To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .","3512":"Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .","3513":"If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .","3514":"When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new \" continent \" - a united Europe .","3515":"It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .","3516":"When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .","3517":"When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .","3518":"The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .","3519":"The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .","3520":"There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .","3521":"Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .","3522":"Trade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .","3523":"There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .","3524":"Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .","3525":"They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .","3526":"Further changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a \" European Standard \" .","3527":"This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of \" 1992 and all that \" .","3528":"A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .","3529":"Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .","3530":"Many people would not .","3531":"Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?","3532":"It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?","3533":"Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .","3534":"As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .","3535":"They must look into the future and consider possible effects .","3536":"Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?","3537":"Perhaps as more of Britain becomes \" Eurofied \" , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .","3538":"Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .","3539":"We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .","3540":"We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .","3541":"We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .","3542":"A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .","3543":"There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .","3544":"Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?","3545":"Firstly , a positive approach .","3546":"Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .","3547":"The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .","3548":"Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .","3549":"Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .","3550":"To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .","3551":"A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .","3552":"Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .","3553":"If this is so , they should also work better .","3554":"Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .","3555":"On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?","3556":"It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .","3557":"Why should this matter ?","3558":"Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .","3559":"It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .","3560":"Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel \" lost \" and that they do not really \" belong \" any more .","3561":"The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .","3562":"Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .","3563":"Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?","3564":"Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .","3565":"Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?","3566":"No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .","3567":"The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .","3568":"This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .","3569":"It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .","3570":"Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .","3571":"The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .","3572":"The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .","3573":"In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .","3574":"However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?","3575":"Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .","3576":"There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .","3577":"The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .","3578":"This fresh start came about because of three main factors .","3579":"Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .","3580":"These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .","3581":"Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European \" civil wars \" . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .","3582":"One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .","3583":"Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .","3584":"One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .","3585":"This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \" integration \" .","3586":"The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .","3587":"All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .","3588":"This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .","3589":"Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .","3590":"The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .","3591":"Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .","3592":"If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .","3593":"On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .","3594":"The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..","3595":"To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .","3596":"While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place .","3597":"The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .","3598":"It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .","3599":"People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .","3600":"It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !","3601":"The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .","3602":"If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .","3603":"Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride .","3604":"My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .","3605":"To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .","3606":"The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .","3607":"The basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .","3608":"This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network .","3609":"The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .","3610":"Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods .","3611":"Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .","3612":"For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .","3613":"Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !","3614":"Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .","3615":"In concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .","3616":"The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .","3617":"If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .","3618":"To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .","3619":"So why do we still insist on travelling on the road .","3620":"The answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that \" it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .","3621":"This is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .","3622":"I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .","3623":"The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent more and more people are now driving .","3624":"We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .","3625":"Why ?","3626":"Do we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?","3627":"Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .","3628":"Even if we did , then shorly so does the rest of the world .","3629":"That could have disasterous implications .","3630":"The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .","3631":"People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .","3632":"The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .","3633":"This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .","3634":"The vital , small rail links may now be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .","3635":"The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .","3636":"Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .","3637":"Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .","3638":"We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno .","3639":"Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .","3640":"Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor .","3641":"Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .","3642":"Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .","3643":"There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .","3644":"These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .","3645":"During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .","3646":"All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .","3647":"During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .","3648":"Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events .","3649":"Although it may sound cruel , I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .","3650":"Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .","3651":"Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .","3652":"Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .","3653":"Although far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .","3654":"The argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .","3655":"Which is good news for the majority of the British public .","3656":"Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .","3657":"Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?","3658":"Every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull .","3659":"This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .","3660":"In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .","3661":"The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .","3662":"But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .","3663":"This example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .","3664":"The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .","3665":"There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .","3666":"This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .","3667":"A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .","3668":"Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .","3669":"He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .","3670":"I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .","3671":"The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .","3672":"The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as \u00a3 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .","3673":"Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons \" next Live Lights \" .","3674":"This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .","3675":"Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .","3676":"These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .","3677":"The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .","3678":"How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .","3679":"This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .","3680":"There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .","3681":"The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .","3682":"The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .","3683":"There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .","3684":"Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .","3685":"My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .","3686":"The British national lottery run by non British firms .","3687":"since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .","3688":"When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .","3689":"There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .","3690":"For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .","3691":"The lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .","3692":"The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .","3693":"It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .","3694":"It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .","3695":"It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .","3696":"It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .","3697":"In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .","3698":"I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .","3699":"Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .","3700":"The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .","3701":"Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .","3702":"In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .","3703":"The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .","3704":"This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .","3705":"This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .","3706":"This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .","3707":"Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .","3708":"Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .","3709":"Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .","3710":"Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .","3711":"People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e -

Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .","3840":"The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .","3841":"Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .","3842":"I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .","3843":"2 .","3844":"Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .","3845":"The foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .","3846":"There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .","3847":"Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .","3848":"Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .","3849":"People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .","3850":"People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .","3851":"All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .","3852":"Bodies can start their days in a test tubes .","3853":"This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .","3854":"This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .","3855":"The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .","3856":"The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .","3857":"This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .","3858":"An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .","3859":"What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .","3860":"Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .","3861":"It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .","3862":"Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .","3863":"The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .","3864":"As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .","3865":"The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .","3866":"The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .","3867":"The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .","3868":"The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .","3869":"If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .","3870":"This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .","3871":"As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .","3872":"Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .","3873":"Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?","3874":"The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .","3875":"This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .","3876":"In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .","3877":"The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a viral disease .","3878":"It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .","3879":"The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .","3880":"However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .","3881":"Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB .","3882":"These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .","3883":"With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .","3884":"Although British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .","3885":"Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .","3886":"People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .","3887":"The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .","3888":"Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .","3889":"Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .","3890":"The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .","3891":"The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .","3892":"It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .","3893":"The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .","3894":"However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .","3895":"Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .","3896":"The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .","3897":"To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .","3898":"If beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .","3899":"Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .","3900":"Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?","3901":"Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .","3902":"Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .","3903":"For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .","3904":"The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .","3905":"Watch this space .","3906":"Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .","3907":"Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .","3908":"Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .","3909":"There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .","3910":"BSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .","3911":"After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .","3912":"Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans .","3913":"This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .","3914":"Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .","3915":"Although scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .","3916":"customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .","3917":"As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .","3918":"An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .","3919":"In my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .","3920":"An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .","3921":"As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .","3922":"This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .","3923":"Because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .","3924":"So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .","3925":"As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .","3926":"I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .","3927":"It has therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the agricultural industry and beef market .","3928":"The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at hand .","3929":"If one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . \"","3930":"Contribution to society \" is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate \" equally ' .","3931":"In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .","3932":"The stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early .","3933":"But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .","3934":"People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .","3935":"Having almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .","3936":"But do they have the right to live this way ?","3937":"What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .","3938":"A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .","3939":"The answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .","3940":"Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .","3941":"A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .","3942":"These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .","3943":"Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid .","3944":"For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .","3945":"So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .","3946":"I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .","3947":"Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .","3948":"Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home .","3949":"Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .","3950":"A lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .","3951":"These are groups of people that have defended women over the years .","3952":"These people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .","3953":"The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women .","3954":"Some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .","3955":"What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .","3956":"This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .","3957":"An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .","3958":"Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .","3959":"They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .","3960":"I felt that these people were crazy .","3961":"Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .","3962":"The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .","3963":"They feel
