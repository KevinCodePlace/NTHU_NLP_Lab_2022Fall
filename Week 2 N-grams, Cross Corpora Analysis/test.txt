Introduction We all know that water masses in the ocean are thought to be transferred by the wind. However, there are actually two ways that water is transferred in the ocean, one is by wind driven currents, the other is by wave driven currents which depend on the nonlinear interaction of waves with water parcels. Understanding the relationship between these two currents is important for understanding the movement of water masses in the oceans. The average effect of the wave driven current is defined as Stokes drift. Stokes drift is a subtle but effective operation which can be just as important to the total drift of a water mass as that of the wind driven component. The theory Lets consider parcel motion is limited in just the x direction (for simplicity). The water parcel is advected by a velocity field, u, so the x-coordinate of the parcel satisfies: We know that the velocity field has two components, a constant wind driven part and a wave driven part which is periodic in space and time: The differential equation above, (1), is different to ordinary differential equations as the right hand side is a function of x as well as t. We therefore need to evolve the solution x(t) explicitly forward in time over one step. Therefore this gives us: Then by substituting in equation (2) we can come to a more useful differential equation. This equation gives us a foundation for exploring different aspects of Stokes drift and an opportunity to see how its characteristics depend on parameters such as wave amplitude. This equation represents the total drift as a function of time. We can write a computer program that solves this equation for a parcel that is released when x(t) equals zero and then continues to solve the equation for varying values of x(t) and t, to show how the x-coordinate varies as a function of time. Appendix 1 shows the program code for this particular operation and the resultant graph below, (graph 1), shows the total drift over time t (seconds). The x axis signifies time and the y axis represents the total drift. Graph 1- Total drift over time t seconds As we can see from this graph, the total or actual drift varies in a periodic motion with time, with the 'wave' type quality originating from the wave driven component of equation (4).This is a superposition of both components and now we shall compare the actual drift of the parcel to the drift due to the wind driven part u 0 Graph 2- Total drift over time t seconds If we were to set the wave driven component to zero we should arrive at a linear relationship with drift and time. This is to be expected as we are removing the wave driven component which is periodic in both space and time. To compare the actual drift of the parcel to the drift due to the wind driven part alone we need to modify our original program and plot the two relationships on the same graph. In Appendix 2 I have set u 1 I have also plotted the result from Graph 1 onto the same set of axis so I can compare the two. As you can see there is only slight deviance from the linear relationship and increases only slightly over time. However, the deviance is enough to show that the wave driven component is an important factor in the total drift and that the movement of water is not totally governed by the wind. Graph 3- u1 (wave driven component) against total drift The next step is to set c, the phase speed, to zero and repeat the experiment for varying amplitude of the wave field u 1 The result is represented in the above graph (Graph 3). This graph represents the drift varying with the amplitude of the wave field u 1 1 Notice that the graph is linear up to the point where u 1 This shows that beyond this point the total drift is mainly responsible by the wind driven component of the drift i.e. u 1 It would be unreasonable to plot different values of u 1 This hereby is my justification of rewriting my original program so that the graph represents axes of amplitude and total drift. The details of this modification plus a brief explanation can be found in Appendix 3. We have been told that for small amplitudes u 1 It states that the total drift of the parcel relative to the drift due to the wind field u 0 so that it varies with the squared amplitude of the wave field To show this we can again modify our original program to fit in with our new equation (5). We are now varying u 1 1 1 To observe this relationship our program should yield a linear correlation between total drift and the square of the amplitude. Graph 4 - (amplitude of wave driven competent) against total drift The x axis on the above graph is the square of the amplitude and the y axis is the total drift. This graph therefore proves that for small amplitudes of the wave field, equation (5) holds up and proves that this approximate theory for Stokes drift exists. This can be supplemented further by computing another graph of u 1 This time the relationship should resemble a curve very similar to a parabola but only in the positive quadrant as both total drift and amplitude are kept positive. Graph 5 - u1 (amplitude) against total drift The x axis represents the amplitude and the y axis represents the total drift. Conclusion This report shows that these wave driven components have just as much influence on the movement of water masses as the wind driven components. The model has firstly shown that the actual drift of a wave is made up of two components, each yielding different graphical forms when separated i.e. the wind driven component is linear whereas the wave driven is periodic. It has also shown that the wave driven component is limited up to the point where the amplitude is 1.0. This could be because of the periodic nature of the component but it shows that there is some threshold amplitude of the wave component where its effect becomes irrelevant and the actual drift is determined by the wind alone. The model has finally shown that for small amplitudes of u 1 This approximation is important because we have already seen the consequences of when the amplitude of the wave driven component equals zero because its effect becomes negligible. Therefore this approximation for when the amplitude is small is important to the total drift of the parcels because without this, the wave driven component would not contribute at all and it would seem as if the wind driven component was the only variable important in the movement of water masses in the ocean.
The receipt of solar radiation can be broken down into two layers: a more general application of radiation received from space and the appreciation of the effect of the earth's atmosphere, among other factors, on the surface heat budget. Solar radiation is our main source of energy here on earth. Many factors can affect how much of this radiation we receive but Figure 1 represents a good approximation of the effect within the earth's atmosphere (see appendix). Firstly however we will ignore the effect of the atmosphere and look at how we primarily receive radiation from the sun. To fully understand solar radiation we first need a brief description. Solar radiation The sun is continually shedding part of its mass by radiating waves of electromagnetic energy and high-energy particles into space. This constant emission represents all the energy available to the earth (with the exception of radioactive material decay here on earth itself). The sun behaves virtually as a black body i.e. it absorbs all energy received and in turn radiates energy at the maximum rate possible for a given temperature. Solar radiation is commonly divided into various regions or bands on the basis of wavelength. Ultraviolet radiation is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum between 100 and 400 nm. It is, in turn, divided into three major components (Fig. 7). For solar radiation about 7 per cent is ultraviolet radiation, 41 per cent is visible light and 52 per cent near infra-red. Solar radiation is very intense and is mainly short wave radiation. We will first assume that all the solar radiation is available to earth and analyse the receipt of solar radiation ignoring the effect of the atmosphere. The amount of energy received at the top of the atmosphere is affected primarily by four factors: solar output, the distance from the sun to the earth, the altitude of the sun and day length. Here is a brief outline of each: Solar output The total solar output to space is 3.84 x 10 -8 -2 -4 The Distance from the Sun This is what defines our seasons. Altitude of the sun Length of day So far, we have described the distribution of solar radiation as if it were all available at the earth's surface. This is, of course, unrealistic because of the effect of the atmosphere on energy transfer. It is important to understand some basic transfers of heat energy to fully appreciate the receipt of solar radiation and its effects at the earth surface. Heat energy can be transferred by three mechanisms: Radiation: Electromagnetic waves transfer energy between two bodies, without the necessary aid of an intervening medium, at the speed of light. This applies to solar radiation as it travels through space. Radiation entering the atmosphere may be absorbed in certain wavelengths by atmospheric gases, but most short wave radiation is transmitted without absorption. Conduction: By this mechanism, heat passes through a substance from a warmer to a colder part through the transfer of adjacent molecular vibrations. Air is a poor conductor so this type of heat transfer is negligible in the atmosphere but important on the ground. Convection: This occurs in fluids that are able to circulate internally and distribute heated parts of their mass. It is the chief means of atmospheric heat transfer. The atmosphere arguably has the biggest effect on the surface receipt of solar radiation as it governs what we know as the surface heat budget, which explains the amount of radiation entering and leaving the atmosphere. The effect of cloud cover, latitude and the land and sea are also important in the surface receipt
